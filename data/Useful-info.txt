Add a page to display ProEd Information from Sam Spiegel, Assistant VP of Online & ProEd at Mines 

	SME application link: Mines SME Application (https://webforms.pipedrive.com/f/clTeQxDh43DxZluuQxlgduRDzDnztn2vjizguzjcyzcHtmzZhocEMbCATC0qF1KMzV)

	SME Info:
		A SME provides content and materials (text, graphics, slides, video, etc.) to develop professional education short courses. This can be for online self-study, online facilitated, in-person, or hybrid courses. An Online Learning Experience Designer (OLED) will work with you to build the online course components or course. The SME will review all course materials before it goes final.
		The areas we are seeking course development around are:
			Energy - future looking (traditional sources, nuclear, geothermal)
			AI use in industry
			Executive education in STEM fields
			Mining & Minerals
			Aerospace
			Construction Engineering
		The time commitment varies depending on which format of course design and the level or organization for the content and materials you would like to use with the course. Typically, it is about 4 hours of preparation for every hour of learning. Some SMEs take longer, while other have it well enough organized that not is less time. New SMEs often find it takes more than they expected.  We provide training (online self-study course) and support across the process.

	Financial Model for Mines ProEd:

		Self-Paced (On-Demand) Courses

		Compensation to SME: $250 per learning hour created, Plus: Revenue share with SME: 20% of net revenue

		      OR

		Compensation to SME: $750 per learning hour created

		Online Facilitated Courses

		Note: Facilitated delivery requires active participation from the instructor throughout the course each time it is taught.

		Compensation to SME: $2,500 per teaching day (e.g., a two-day course would be $5,000)

		Plus: $1,250 preparation fee for each teaching day

		Plus: Revenue share with SME: 20% of net revenue
		
	Promotion Gaps:

		Promotion of ProEd is still in the awareness building. Word of mouth and any opportunities to make other alumni aware of the program would be greatly appreciated. Our primary efforts are currently through email campaigns (based on funding and resources). The swipe sheet can help with links and language.

		We will be one of the highlighted causes during idigMines events in mid February.

	AI Use:

		Sam is happy to open the conversation again about using AI both in the courses and in promotion. The HiTA program is only available for credit-bearing courses, so not for ProEd. I’m not certain what the future plans are for that program.
